ReadSpec application: making PBT easier to read for humans

compiling & running
-------------------

Just clone the repository and execute

    make && ./run

You should then see an erlang shell in which you can try the following provided
examples:

    cd(priv).
    c(simple_eqc).
    readspec:suite(simple_eqc, prop_simple, 20).

or

    cd(priv).
    c(register_eqc).
    readspec:suite(register_eqc, prop_register, 35).

This will create a ?MODULE.feature file with a human-readable version of a test
case example generated by QC from the corresponding test property/model.

troubleshooting
---------------

If you encounter any errors while executing the examples above, make sure you
load the readspec module before changing into the priv directory:

    l(readspec).
